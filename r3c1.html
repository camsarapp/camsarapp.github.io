    <div class="redtitle">Ordnance Survey Maps</div>
    <div class="greentext">Generally, we use 1:25,000 and 1:10,000 scale Ordnance Survey maps, which are great for us to
      use.<br><br>However, it is imperative that you understand the age of these maps before fully trusting the content
      that they show.<br><br>If you are viewing these digitally, you can often see discrepancies as you zoom in through
      the different layers and levels.</div>
    <div class="redtitle">Satellite Maps</div>
    <div class="greentext">This is another great map type for us to use but itâ€™s important to remember that satellite
      maps will only show what was visible at the time of capture.<br><br>Therefore, you should treat the content with
      caution, as there may have been significant environmental changes between when the image was captured and when you
      are using it.</div>
    <div class="redtitle">Local Paper Maps</div>
    <div class="greentext">In some areas, it is possible to get local maps of an area, but when using these it is always
      important to be aware of the age and therefore the current validity of such mapping.<br><br>What they can show is
      areas of interest and pathways/routes that may not be visible on other forms of mapping.</div>
    <div class="redtitle">Visitor Maps</div>
    <div class="greentext">When deploying in nature reserves/visitor centres there will often be mapping available in
      leaflets or on boards around the car park and site.<br><br>These maps are worth using or photographing for use
      during the deployment, as it may indicate certain features and pathways around the site which may be beneficial to
      the tasking.</div>
