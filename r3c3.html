    <div class="redtitle">Aiming Off</div>
    <div class="greentext">Aiming off is aiming at a line feature deliberately to one side of the
      target.<br><br>Reaching the target directly could be difficult in poor visibility, and if it is missed, the team
      would not know which direction to go in order to find it.<br><br>Therefore, when the line feature is reached, the
      team will know which direction to go along the line feature (i.e. handrail the line feature) to reach the target.
    </div>
    <div class="redtitle">Attack Points</div>
    <div class="greentext">If the objective is a small or difficult to find feature, aim for another, more obvious
      feature.<br><br>When you find this ‘attack point’ it should now be less of a distance to your main objective, and
      therefore easier for you to find you initial desired point.</div>
    <div class="redtitle">Bearings</div>
    <div class="greentext">A bearing is the direction from your location to any distant point given in degrees from
      north.<br><br>If you point your compass at a distant point and the compass reads 56 degrees, then the bearing to
      this point is 56 degrees.<br><br>The short distances that we travel means we do not need to worry about the
      variation between true and magnetic north.</div>
    <div class="redtitle">Grid References</div>
    <div class="greentext">A GPS unit commonly gives a ten-digit grid reference, based on two groups of five numbers for
      the easting and northing values.<br><br>Each successive increase in precision (from six-digit to eight-digit to
      ten-digit) pinpoints the location more precisely by a factor of ten.<br><br>This means that an eight-figure grid
      reference, such as ‘1926 4548’, indicates a 10m by 10m square on the map and a ten-figure grid reference, such as
      ‘19267 45487’, indicates a 1m by 1m square on the map.<br><br>In the world of Search and Rescue, we generally use
      eight-digit and ten-digit figure grid references as we need this accuracy to locate smaller areas with
      precision.<br><br>Also, grid references are prefixed by two letters.</div>
    <div class="redtitle">Handrails and Linear Features</div>
    <div class="greentext">These are streams, rivers, ditch lines, paths, forest edges, field boundaries or anything
      similar that hasn’t been moved.<br><br>Following handrails may be longer than the direct route, but you have a
      definite line that you can follow to get to your target.<br><br>You can also go from one handrail to another to
      get you to your target.</div>
    <div class="redtitle">what3words</div>
    <div class="greentext">what3words is a geocode system that is designed to identify and differentiate any location
      with a resolution of about 3 metres.<br><br>what3words differs from most other location encoding systems due its
      use of three words rather than strings of numbers or letters to represent locations.<br><br>It is believed that
      this significantly reduces the rate of transcription errors.<br><br>For the best transcription we suggest that you
      send a w3w picture via Hangouts to minimise errors.</div>
